        <p class="mbr-description mbr-fonts-style mb-0 align-center display-7"><a href="https://jupiter-dex.github.io" class="text-primary">Jupiter DEX</a>, also known as Jupiter Exchange, is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on top of the Solana Network. It was launched in 2021 by a developer or group of developers with the pseudonymous name "Meow". <a href="https://jup.ag/" class="text-primary">Jupiter DEX</a> aims to provide users with a seamless and efficient trading experience by aggregating liquidity from various DEXs and automated market makers (AMMs) within the Solana ecosystem.
<br>
<br><strong>Key Features of Jupiter DEX
<br></strong>
<br><strong>Liquidity Aggregation: </strong>Jupiter DEX acts as a liquidity aggregator, connecting DEX markets and AMM pools together, regardless of the provider. This allows users to access the best prices and liquidity across multiple platforms.<br><br><strong>Smart Routing:</strong> Jupiter DEX employs smart routing algorithms to find the most optimal routes for token trades. It compares prices between markets on different DEXs and may even route trades through intermediary tokens to achieve the best price due to price inefficiencies and volatility in the markets.<br>
<br><strong>Trade Splitting:</strong> To ensure users get the best prices, Jupiter DEX splits trades into smaller sizes. This is particularly beneficial for large trades or trades with tokens that have shallow liquidity spread across multiple DEXs. By splitting the trade, Jupiter DEX can optimize the trade execution and provide better prices.
<br>
<br><strong>Automatic Listing of New Tokens and Markets:</strong> Jupiter DEX automatically lists new tokens and markets as long as they meet the liquidity requirements. This ensures that users can trade new tokens as soon as they launch on the Solana network, and have access to the latest liquidity for any listed token.
<br>
<br><strong>Swap in a Single Transaction:</strong> Jupiter DEX has optimized its swap aggregation to fit within transaction limits, allowing users to complete their swaps in a single transaction. This is important to handle cases where the price of the token being bought has changed, and the initial transaction no longer fits the user's slippage limit. If the trade cannot be executed within the slippage limit, Jupiter DEX will rollback the transaction and return an error.
<br>
<br><strong>Trading Process on Jupiter DEX
<br></strong>
<strong><br>Token Selection:</strong> Users enter the tokens they want to trade on Jupiter DEX.
<br>
<strong><br>Trade Amount:</strong> Users specify the amount of tokens they want to trade for.
<br>
<br><strong>Route Calculation:</strong> Jupiter DEX calculates all possible routes for the token trade.
<br>
<strong><br>Quote Fetching:</strong> Jupiter DEX fetches quotes for each route, including all fees, and returns the amount of tokens the user will receive per route.
<br>
<br><strong>Route Ranking: </strong>Jupiter DEX ranks each route based on the number of tokens the user will receive.
<br>
<br><strong>Route Selection:</strong> Users can select any route, but the first route typically offers the most tokens.
<br>
<br><strong>Swap Trigger:</strong> Users click to trigger the swap.
<br>
<strong><br>Transaction Approval: </strong>Users approve the Jupiter DEX transactions from their wallet.
<br>
<br><strong>Trade Execution:</strong> Jupiter DEX executes the trade on behalf of the user.
<br>
<br><strong>Jupiter DEX Airdrop
<br></strong>
<br>Jupiter DEX has planned a significant airdrop of its native utility and governance token, $JUP. A total of 40% of the total supply of $JUP has been allocated for the airdrop. The airdrop has been divided into specific time frames, each with different qualification requirements. The first phase of the airdrop will release one billion Jupiter tokens to 955,000 eligible users who have carried out a minimum of $1,000 in swap volume on the protocol by a specific snapshot date. Future airdrop rounds will also reward new users.
<br>
<br>In summary, Jupiter DEX is a decentralized exchange built on the Solana Network that aims to provide users with the best prices and liquidity by aggregating liquidity from various DEXs and AMMs. With its smart routing, trade splitting, and automatic listing of new tokens and markets, Jupiter DEX offers a seamless trading experience. Additionally, the upcoming airdrop of its native token, $JUP, provides an opportunity for users to participate in the platform's governance and utility.
